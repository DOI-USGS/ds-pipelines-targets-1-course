Data analyses are often complex. Data pipelines are ways of managing that complexity. Our data pipelines have two foundational pieces:

* Good organization of code scripts help you quickly find the file you need, whether you or a teammate created it.

* Dependency managers such as `remake`, `scipiper`, `snakemake`, `drake`, and `targets` formalize the relationships among the datasets and functions to ensure reproducibility while also minimizing the amount of unnecessary runtime as you're creating or modifying parts of the pipeline.

:keyboard: Activity: Assign yourself to this issue to get started.

:bulb: Tip: Throughout this course, I, the Learning Lab Bot, will reply and direct you to the next step each time you complete an activity. But sometimes I'm _too_ fast when I :hourglass_flowing_sand: give you a reply, and occasionally you'll need to refresh the current GitHub page to see it. Please be patient, and let my humans know (`jread-usgs` or `aappling-usgs`) if I seem to have become completely stuck.
