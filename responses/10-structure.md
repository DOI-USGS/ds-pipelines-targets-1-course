You should organize your code into functions, targets, and conceptual "phases" of work. 

Often we create temporary code or are sent scripts that look like [my_work_R/my_happy_script.R]({{ repoUrl }}/blob/main/my_work_R/my_happy_script.R) in this repository. Take a minute to look through that file now. 

This code has some major issues, including that it uses a directory that is specific to a user, it plots to a non-project file location, and the structure of the code makes it hard to figure out what is happening. This simple example is a starting point for understanding the investments we make to move towards code that is more reproducible, more shareable, and understandable. Additionally, we want to structure our code and our projects in a way where we can build on top of them as the projects progress. 

Assign this issue to yourself and then we'll get started on code and project structures.
