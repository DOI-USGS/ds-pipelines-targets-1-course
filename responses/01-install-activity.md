### :keyboard: Installing tools

To complete this section, you'll need some R packages. You will need to install `targets` and its companion package, `tarchetypes`. 

```r
install.packages(c("targets", "tarchetypes"))
```

While you are at it, please install a few other packages that you'll use along the way:

```r
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "sbtools", "whisker", "dataRetrieval"))
```

When all packages are installed, comment with the message that appears after you run `packageVersion("targets")`.
