Our `targets` pipelines in R use a `makefile` file to orchestrate the connections among files, functions, and phases. In this issue, we're going to develop a basic understanding of how these files work, starting with the anatomy of the `_targets.R` file.

#### Setting up a `targets` data science pipeline

In addition to phases (which we covered in {{ store.structure_activity_url }}), it is important to decompose high-level concepts (or existing scripts) into thoughtful functions and "targets" that form the building blocks of data processing pipelines. A target is a noun we use to describe a tangible output of function, which is often a file or an R object. Targets can be used as an end-product (like a summary map) or as input _into_ another function to create _another_ target. 

To set up a `targets` pipeline, you will need to create the base makefile named `_targets.R` that will declare and orchestrate the rest of the pipeline connections.

---
The simplest version of `_targets.R` might look something like this:

```r
library(targets)
source("code.R")
tar_option_set(packages = c("tidyverse", "stringr", "sbtools", "whisker"))

list(
  tar_target(
    model_RMSEs_csv,
    download_data(out_filepath = "model_RMSEs.csv"),
    format = "file"
  ), 
  tar_target(
    plot_data,
    process_data(in_filepath = model_RMSEs_csv),
  ),
  tar_target(
    figure_1_png,
    make_plot(out_filepath = "figure_1.png", data = plot_data), 
    format = "file"
  )
)
```


This file defines the relationships between different "targets" (see how the target `model_RMSEs_csv` is an input to the command that creates the target `plot_data`?), tells us where to find any functions that are used to build targets (see the `source` call that points you to `code.R`), and declares the package dependencies needed to build the different targets (see the `target_option_set()` command that passes in a vector of packages). 

We'll briefly explain some of the functions and conventions used here. For more extensive explanations, visit [the `targets` documentation](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/walkthrough.html). 

  - As you would with normal R scripts, put any `source` commands for loading R files and `library` commands for loading packages at the top of the file. The packages loaded here should be only those needed to build the targets _plan_; packages needed to build specific _targets_ can be loaded later.
  - Declare each target by using the function `tar_target()` and passing in a target name (`name` arg) and the expression to run to build the target (`command` arg).
  - There are two types of targets - objects and files. If your target is a file, you need to add `format = "file"` to your `tar_target()` call and the command needs to return the filename of the new file.
  - Setup the full pipeline by combining all targets into a single `list` object.
  - There are 2 ways to define packages used to build targets: 1) declare using the `packages` argument in `tar_option_set()` in your makefile to specify packages used by all targets or 2) use the `packages` argument in individual `tar_target()` functions for packages that are specific to those targets.
  - `model_RMSEs_csv` shows up two times - why? `model_RMSEs_csv` is the name of a target that creates the file `model_RMSEs.csv` when the command `download_data()` is run. When passed in as input to other functions (unquoted), it represents the filename of the file that was created when it was built. So when `model_RMSEs_csv` shows up as an _argument_ to another function, `process_data()`, it is really passing in the filename. The `process_data()` function then reads the files and changes the data (or "processes" it) in some way.

We're going to start with this simple example, and modify it to match our pipeline structure. This will start by creating a new branch, creating a new file, adding that file to git tracking, and opening a new pull request that includes the file:

### :keyboard: Activity: get your code plugged into a makefile

First things first: We're going to want a new branch. You can delete your previous one, since that pull request was merged. 
```
git checkout main
git pull
git branch -d structure
git checkout -b makefile
git push -u origin makefile 
```
---
Next, create the file with the contents we've given you by entering the following from your repo directory in terminal/command line:
```
cat > _targets.R
library(targets)
source("code.R")
tar_option_set(packages = c("tidyverse", "stringr", "sbtools", "whisker"))

list(
  tar_target(
    model_RMSEs_csv,
    download_data(out_filepath = "model_RMSEs.csv"),
    format = "file"
  ), 
  tar_target(
    plot_data,
    process_data(in_filepath = model_RMSEs_csv),
  ),
  tar_target(
    figure_1_png,
    make_plot(out_filepath = "figure_1.png", data = plot_data), 
    format = "file"
  )
)
```    

then use `Ctrl+D` to exit the file creation mode and return to the prompt. 

---
Finally, create a [pull request]({{ repoUrl }}/pulls) that includes this new file (the file should be called `_targets.R`).
