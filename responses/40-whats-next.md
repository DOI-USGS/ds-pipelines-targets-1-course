You are doing a great job, @{{ user.username }}! :star2: :collision: :tropical_fish:

But you may be asking why we asked you to go through all of the hard work of connecting functions, files, and targets together using a makefile. We don't blame you for wondering...

The real power of depedency management is when something changes - that's the EUREKA! moment, but we haven't put you in a situation where it would show up. That will come further down the road on later training activities and also in the project work you will be exposed to. 

In the meantime, here are a few nice tricks given you have a functional pipeline. 

- [ ] run `tar_make()` again. What happens? Hopefully not much. I see this: 
![make all is fresh](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13220910/113453089-eb94b380-93ca-11eb-92b6-25032835c028.png)
Which means everthing is up to date so all targets are :OK:

- [ ] now try making a change to one of your functions in your code. What happens after running `tar_make()` then? 

- [ ] access the `plot_data` target by using `tar_load(plot_data)`. (You may or may not have an R-object target named `plot_data` in your own repo at this point, so go ahead and try it with some target that you do have.) In this example, we have passed in the unquoted target name `plot_data` to `tar_load()` which creates a data.frame object in our environment called `plot_data` because that's what our example function `process_data()` creates. If you load a file target, like `tar_load(model_RMSEs_csv)`, the resulting object in your environment is a character vector with the path to the target's file.

- [ ] now try making a change to the `template_1` variable in your function that creates the .txt file. What happens after running `tar_make()` then? Which targets get rebuilt and which do not?

Lastly, imagine the following comment appeared on your pull request. 

> Oh shoot @{{ user.username }}, I am using your results for **FANCY BIG PROJECT** and I have coded everything to assume your outputs use a character for the experiment number (the `exper_n` column), of the form "01", "02", etc. It looks like you are using numbers. Can you update your code accordingly? 

Would your code be easy to adjust to satisfy this request? Would you need to re-run any steps that aren't associated with this naming choice? Did the use of a dependency management solution allow you to both make the change efficiently (i.e., by avoiding rebuilding any unnecessary parts of the pipeline) and increase your confidence in delivering the results?

### You have completed introductions to pipelines I. Great work!
