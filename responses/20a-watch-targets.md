Great comments @{{ user.username }}! :sparkles:

You could consider [GNU make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) to be a great grandparent of the packages we referred to early in this lesson (`remake`, `scipiper`, `drake`, and `targets`). Will Landau, the lead developer of `targets`, has added a lot of useful features to dependency management systems in R, and has a great way of summarizing why we put energy into using these tools: **"Skip the work you don't need"**

We'd like you to next check out a short part of Will's video on `targets`

### :tv: Activity: watch video on targets from at least 7:20 to 11:05 (you are welcome to watch the full talk if you'd like)

Use a github comment on this issue to let us know what contrasts you identified between solutions in `make` and what is offered in R-specific tools, like `targets`. Please use less than 300 words. Then assign your onboarding cohort team member this issue to read what you wrote and respond with any questions or comments.
