Great comments @{{ user.username }}! :sparkles:

You could consider [GNU make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) to be a great grandparent of the packages we referred to early in this lesson (`remake`, `scipiper`, `drake`, and `targets`). Will Landau, the lead developer of `targets`, has added a lot of useful features to dependency management systems in R, and has a great way of summarizing why we put energy into using these tools: **"Skip the work you don't need"**

We'd like you to next check out a short part of Will's video on `targets`
