Great comments @{{ user.username }}! :sparkles:

You could consider [GNU make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) to be a great grandparent of the packages we asked you to install early in this lesson (`drake`, `remake`, and `scipiper`). The lead of `drake` has added a lot of useful features to dependency management systems in R, and has a great way of summarizing why we put energy into using these tools. **"Skip the work you don't need"**

We'd like you to next check out a short part of Will's video on `drake`
