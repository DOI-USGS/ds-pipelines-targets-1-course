We're asking everyone to invest in the concepts of _reproducibility_ and _efficiency of reproducibility_, both of which are enabled via dependency management systems such as `remake`, `scipiper`, `drake`, and `targets`.

#### Background
We hope that the case for _reproducibility_ is clear - we work for a science agency, and science that can't be reproduced does little to advance knowledge or trust. 

But, the investment in _efficiency of reproducibility_ is harder to boil down into a zingy one-liner. Many of us have embraced this need because we have been bitten issues in our real-world collaborations, and found that data science practices and a reproducibility culture offer great solutions. Karl Broman is an advocate for reproducibility in science and is faculty at UW Madison. He has given many talks on the subject and we're going to ask you to watch part of one of them so you can be exposed to some of Karl's science challenges and solutions. Karl will be talking about [GNU make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/), which is the inspiration for almost every modern dependency tool that we can think of.
