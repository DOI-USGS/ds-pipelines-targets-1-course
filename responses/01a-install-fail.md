Uh oh, I didn't find what I was looking for. Your package may have failed to install. Let's try again!

```r
install.packages(c("targets", "tarchetypes"))
library(targets)
```

When both pipeline packages are installed, comment with the message that appears after you run `packageVersion("targets")`.
